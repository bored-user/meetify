# meetify

This is the source code for the Meetify extension. It automatically adds the `?authuser=1` query string to the URL, switching to school email.

Note that the extension uses [jQuery 3.5.1 slim version](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js).

Feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/bored-user/meetify/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/bored-user/meetify/pulls). All help is welcome.
